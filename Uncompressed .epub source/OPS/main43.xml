This raised the interesting question of how many other fractional platforms lay between the whole-numbered platforms at King's Cross, and I concluded that were probably quite a few. Although these are never mentioned in the book, I like to think that it is possible to take a version of the Orient Express off to wizard-only villages in continental Europe (try platform seven and a half), and that other platforms may be opened on an as-required-basis, for instance for large, one-off events such as Celestina Warbeck concerts (see your ticket for details).</p>                    <p>"The number nine and three-quarters presented itself without much conscious thought, and I liked it so much that I took it at once. It is the 'three-quarters' that makes it, of course."</p>                    <p>---</p>                    <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/platform-nine-and-three-quarters">                        <p>Pottermore Link</p>                    </a>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
