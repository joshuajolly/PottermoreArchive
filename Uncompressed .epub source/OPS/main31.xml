It enables the consumer to assume the physical appearance of another person, as long as they first procured part of that individual's body to add to the brew (this may be anything - toenail clippings, dandruff or worse - but it is most usual to use hair) The idea that a witch or wizard might make use of parts of the body is an ancient one, and exists in the folklore and superstitions of many cultures.</p>                    <p>The of the potion is only temporary, and depending on how well it has been brewed , may last anything from between ten minutes and twelve hours. You can change age, sex and race by taking the Polyjuice Potion, but not species.</p>                    <h3>JKR's thoughts</h3>                    <p>I remember creating the fill list of ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion. Each one was carefully selected. Lacewing flies (the first part of the name suggested an intertwining or binding together of identities); leeches (to suck the essence out of one and into the other); horn of a Bicorn (the idea of duality); knotgrass (another hint of being tied to another person); fluxweed (the mutability of the body as it changed into another) and Boomslang skin (a shedded outer body and a new inner).</p>                    <p>The fact that Hermione is able to make a competent Polyjuice Potion at the age of twelve is testimony to her outstanding magical ability, because it is a potion that many adult witches and wizards fear to attempt. </p>                    <p>---</p>                    <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/polyjuice-potion">                        <p>Pottermore Link</p>                    </a>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
