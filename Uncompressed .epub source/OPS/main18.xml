I’m Prefect Percy Weasley, and I’m delighted to welcome you to GRYFFINDOR HOUSE. Our emblem is the lion, the bravest of all creatures; our house colours are scarlet and gold, and our common room lies up in Gryffindor Tower.</p>                    <p>This is, quite simply, the best house at Hogwarts. It’s where the bravest and boldest end up - for instance: Albus Dumbledore! Yes, Dumbledore himself, the greatest wizard of our time, was a Gryffindor! If that’s not enough for you, I don’t know what it is.</p>                    <p>I won’t keep you long, as all you need to do to find out more about your house is to follow Harry Potter and his freinds as I lead them up to their dormitories. Enjoy your time at Hogwarts - but how could you fail to? You’ve become part of the best house in the school.</p>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
