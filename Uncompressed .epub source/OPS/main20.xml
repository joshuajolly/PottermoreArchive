The Stone was believed to turn base metals into gold, and also to produce the Elixir of Life, which could make you immortal. 'Genuine' alchemists - the forerunners of chemists and physicists - such as Sir Isaac Newton and (the real) Nicolas Flamel, sought, sometimes over lifetimes, to discover the secret of its creation.</p>                    <p>The Stone is variously described as red and white in the many old texts in which it appears. These colours are important in most accounts of alchemy, and are often interpreted as having symbolic meaning.</p>                    <p>---</p>                    <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-philosophers-stone">                        <p>Pottermore Link</p>                    </a>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
