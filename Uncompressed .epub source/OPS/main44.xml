Do not wiggle or twirl your wand unnecessarily, or the Transfiguration will certainly be unsuccessful.</p>                    <p>Form a clear mental picture of the object you are hoping to create before attempting a Transfiguring spell.</p>                    <p>Beginners should say the spell clearly. More advanced wizards do not need to say the spell aloud.</p>                    <p>Incomplete Transfigurations are difficult to put right, but you must attempt to do so. Leaving the head of a rabbit on a footstool is irresponsible and dangerous. Say ‘Reparifarge!’ and the object or creature should return to its natural state.</p>                    <p>Larger creatures are difficult to Transfigure except by skilled and powerful wizards.
