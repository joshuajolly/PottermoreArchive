This book does not deal with such spells.</p>                    <p>Lapses in concentration while charming can result in painful side effects - remember Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself lying on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.</p>                    <p>Some charms will be ineffective on large creatures such as trolls, whose hides repel all but the most powerful spells.</p>                </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
